The idea is : whenever you encounter a word you don't know and would like to learn (say while watching an anime), you can extract that word and the surrounding context and turn it into a flashcard; this is known as sentence mining which falls under the more general hood of immersion-based learning. </p> <p>There are VERY detailed setups / guides on how to do this, some of them also include software and workflows to help automate flashcard creation. Personally, I can't be bothered, but it is fascinating to see some of the effort and research people put into this stuff.
