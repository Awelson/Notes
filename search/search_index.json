It is especially popular with the Japanese language learning community for memorizing vocabulary and grammar.

Personally, I can't be bothered but I looked into it anyway. The idea is : whenever you encounter a word you don't know and would like to learn (say while watching an anime), you can extract that word and the surrounding context and turn it into a flashcard; this is known as sentence mining which falls under the more general hood of immersion-based learning.</p> <p>There are VERY detailed setups / guides on how to do this and I will list some of the ones I came across in no particular order :</p> <ul> <li>Animecards</li> <li>donkuri</li> <li>lazyguide</li> <li>jp-mining-note</li> <li>itazuraneko</li> </ul> <p>There are also YT videos on this topic :</p> <ul> <li>mikumino</li> <li>Jouzu Juls</li> <li>Livakivi</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Notes/2025/12/07/mkdocs--better-tooltips/","title":"MkDocs : Better Tooltips?","text":"<p>MkDocs already supports tooltips natively.
