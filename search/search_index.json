To put it shortly, what I do on a pretty much daily basis is watch or read Japanese content, say from anime, YouTube, manga, news, etc.. I am not sure what the effective amount is, but personally, about half of what I consume is Japanese (because I am just that much of a weeb). If I encounter a word or grammar that I am not familiar with, I will try to do some research. Afterwards, I will go back to the sentence (where the word/grammar originated) and check to see if what I have learned makes sense in the original context. Rinse and repeat and that is basically all I have been doing up till this point. </p> <p>Obivously, what I am describing is not new; it falls under what is known as active immersion. The effectiveness of immersion in comparison to more traditional methods (textbooks, etc..) is a popular (and sometimes toxic) topic of debate in the Japanese language learning community. I do not claim that whatever I am doing will work for you, but at the very least there may be some ideas you can use.</p>"},{"location":"Notes/2025/12/23/how-i-learn-japanese-part-1--intro/#background","title":"Background","text":"<p>I will point out that I did not initially plan to study Japanese, but I enjoyed Japanese YouTubers (I was first introduced through translated clips), and there was eventually a need (which translated clips alone could not satisfy) to watch their content and keep up with the latest info. With the limited amount of Japanese I knew at the time and through sheer stubbornness towards wanting to be part of the fandom, I would painstakingly try to translate and understand videos, tweets, comments, etc.. myself. Without realizing, it became a routine which I'd spend hours each day doing and my Japanese got better just as a byproduct; after all, the main goal was just trying to be part of the fandom.</p> <p>I guess what I am trying to say is that motivation is super important for learning new languages, so it might be helpful to think about why you want to be able to understand Japanese in the first place and focus on that as a goal instead, i.e. we want to make it so that learning Japanese becomes a means to an end. It is important that whatever goal you choose should absolutely require knowing Japanese to be achieved; something like \"I want to be able to enjoy anime\" is not ideal since you could always default to using translations to achieve that goal.</p> <p>Obviously, this \"workflow\" will require you to know a bit of Japanese beforehand. At a minimum, you should aim towards already knowing about 30-40% of the vocabulary / grammar you will encounter for this to work without friction; in terms of JLPT levels, this probably amounts to somewhere between N4 and N3. The idea is : you want to be able to get to a point where you can, on your own, be able to at least understand the main plot of whatever it is you are watching or reading so that there is some form of enjoyment to be gained from the process; I just arbitrarily decided that knowing about 30-40% of the content should be enough for this task. You can refer to some of the excellent guides I showcased in an earlier note to help you get started to reaching this point. </p>"},{"location":"Notes/2025/12/23/how-i-learn-japanese-part-1--intro/#whats-next","title":"What's Next?","text":"<p>In the next part, I will be talking about how I source Japanese content to watch / read, as well as some of the tools I use to help streamline this process.</p>"},{"location":"Notes/2025/12/10/resources-and-guides-for-learning-japanese/","title":"Resources and Guides for Learning Japanese","text":"<p>There are sooo many websites dedicated to helping people get started with learning Japanese.
