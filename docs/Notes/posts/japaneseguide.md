There are sooo many websites dedicated to helping people get started with learning Japanese. The level of effort and detail that has been put into some of these are insane. I've made a list of some of my favorites here :

<!-- more -->

### [Itazuraneko](https://djtguide.github.io/index.html)

also known as the Daily Japanese Thread (DJT) guide. This is probably the most extensive resource / guide out there. Some of the highlights include :

- a [library section](https://djtguide.github.io/library/librarymain.html) where you can find manga, textbooks, light novels, etc...
- a [list of explanations](https://djtguide.github.io/horon/kotoba/chigai.html) for differences in nuance between words/phrases with similar meanings.
- a [master list](https://djtguide.github.io/grammar/masterreference.html) of Japanese grammar compiled from 5 different sources.

and so much more, check it out yourself. Below are some mirrors for this website in case the main link no longer works :

### [Tatsumoto Ren](https://tatsumoto-ren.github.io/blog/table-of-contents.html)

A guide for learning Japanese based on the [All Japanese All The Time](https://tatsumoto-ren.github.io/blog/whats-ajatt.html) (AJATT) method. Their [list of resources](https://tatsumoto-ren.github.io/blog/resources.html) is very extensive and useful. 

### [TheMoeWay](https://learnjapanese.moe/)

A guide for learning Japanese with a focus on using anime, manga, VNs, etc.. Their [list of resources](https://learnjapanese.moe/resources/) is also very extensive and useful.

### [Wotaku](https://wotaku.wiki/japan/language)

Mainly a resource aggregator for otakus, but also has a great section for Japanese language learning.

### [Japanese with Anime](https://www.japanesewithanime.com/)

A guide which uses sentence examples from anime and manga to explain grammar concepts and vocabulary. The vocabulary you can learn from this website is heavily geared toward otaku culture. For example, there are explanations for words like : [isekai (異世界)](https://www.japanesewithanime.com/2017/07/isekai.html), [NEET (ニート)](https://www.japanesewithanime.com/2016/10/neet.html), etc...

Beyond that, the website also hosts pages on more general topics in otaku culture, like a page explaining what is meant by an [OVA](https://www.japanesewithanime.com/2017/03/ova.html) and how it compares to [ONAs](https://www.japanesewithanime.com/2017/03/ona.html) and [OADs](https://www.japanesewithanime.com/2020/05/oad.html). There are also pages which explain common anime tropes like the [tehepero](https://www.japanesewithanime.com/2019/12/tehepero.html) pose or the [*anime fang*](https://www.japanesewithanime.com/2020/04/anime-fang.html). Pages which explain internet slang terms like [*wwww*](https://www.japanesewithanime.com/2017/11/w-ww-meaning-japanese.html), and many more...

### [Kuzuri](https://kuzuri.neocities.org/)

This website lists commonly misused Japanese words and phrases and explains how to avoid those mistakes.

### [Sakubi](https://sakubi.neocities.org/), [Imabi](https://imabi.org/), [Yokubi](https://yoku.bi/)

All three of these are excellent Japanese grammar references. Although [Imabi](https://imabi.org/) is very well written and extensive, many people regard it as being too terse and academic. As a response, [Sakubi](https://sakubi.neocities.org/) was created as a more accessible alternative. Later on, some people decided to revise and restructure [Sakubi](https://sakubi.neocities.org/), resulting in what is now known as [Yokubi](https://yoku.bi/). Other noteworthy grammar references include [Tofugu](https://www.tofugu.com/) and [Bunpro](https://bunpro.jp/).

!!! warning

    As of December 2025, Yokubi is still in development and not fully complete. 

### [Cure Dolly](https://www.youtube.com/@organicjapanesewithcuredol49)

was a VTuber who came up with quite a novel model to explain Japanese sentence structure. She has a [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLg9uYxuZf8x_A-vcqqyOFZu06WlhnypWj) with 93 lessons teaching Japanese from scratch with this model. If you are not a video type of person, you can also refer to [the notes](https://kellenok.github.io/cure-script/) that have been made based on her videos. Unfortunately, Cure Dolly passed away back in 2021 despite there being so much more to teach.

### [Konomu](https://konomu.github.io/wa-ga-basics)

How does one choose between は and が? This is a notoriously difficult question to answer, so much so that [entire books](https://www.amazon.co.jp/%E3%80%8C%E3%81%AF%E3%80%8D%E3%81%A8%E3%80%8C%E3%81%8C%E3%80%8D-%E6%96%B0%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%AC%E8%AA%9E%E6%96%87%E6%B3%95%E9%81%B8%E6%9B%B8-1-%E9%87%8E%E7%94%B0-%E5%B0%9A%E5%8F%B2/dp/487424128X) have been written on this topic. This website is a **very** long guide which goes over all the nuances in dealing with this question.
