This is Part 2 of "How I Learn Japanese" :

- Part 2 : Content

Naturally, the Japanese content that I read and watch is heavily based on my personal interests, and I would encourage you to do the same. That said, there are some general concepts and ideas which are useful to know.

<!-- more -->

## Tools to get started

### [Google IME](https://www.google.co.jp/ime/)

Learning to type in Japanese will be very helpful since you need to be able to do so in order to search for Japanese content to consume. There are multiple options, but I personally use Google IME to type in Japanese. There are many tutorial videos on YouTube to help get you started, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRtkiRchnF8) is one for Google IME specifically.

### [Yomitan](https://yomitan.wiki/)

is a pop-up dictionary which you can install as a browser extension. You will also need to import a Japanese dictionary ([Jitendex](https://jitendex.org/) is recommended). Once everything is set up, a definition will pop-up simply by hovering over a piece of Japanese text, and then holding the `shift` key. While yomitan is limited to content displayed in the browser, it is good to know that you can get around this by using tools (I describe some of them below) to load external content (manga, videos, etc..) into the browser.   

### [fuseji.net](https://fuseji.net/)

In Japanese, the 〇 (丸) symbol is used for censorship, for example : エッチ $\to$ エ〇チ. If you encounter such censorhip, you can use fuseji.net to help [fill in the blank](https://fuseji.net/エ〇チ). This is also useful in case the audio isn't super clear; just add 〇 to whatever part of a sentence is unclear and fuseji.net will try to guess the full sentence for you. For example, click the link below to check out what fuseji.net thinks the complete sentence should be :

<div markdown="1">
<p style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">[全〇本大〇女〇〇〇対〇〇〇権〇会](https://fuseji.net/全〇本大〇女〇〇〇対〇〇〇権〇会)</p>
</div>

Alternatively, you could ask an LLM to do the same task and it will perform just as well, if not better.

### [Subtitle Edit](https://github.com/SubtitleEdit/subtitleedit)

is a piece of software that allows you to edit and make subtitles with the use of an audio-to-text model. Personally, I use [whisper's](https://github.com/openai/whisper) large-v3-turbo model with a CPP engine, but you should choose what works best for you based on whatever hardware you have available. 

This is useful in case you have a piece of media, for which no subtitle is provided, that you want to use for immersion. Obviously the model will make mistakes here and there, so proceed with caution.

## Where do I get content?

### Surfing the web

I am not trying to say that everytime you want to search something up, you should force yourself to do so in Japanese. Instead, there plenty of natural reasons for why it would be a better idea to do so. For instance, I was interested in the art of 落語 (Rakugo) after finishing [Descending Stories: Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinju](https://myanimelist.net/anime/28735/Shouwa_Genroku_Rakugo_Shinjuu/). I wanted to learn more, but the [English Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rakugo) was lacking some of the info I was interested in. On the other hand, the [Japanese version](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%90%BD%E8%AA%9E) is far more comprehensive and better suited to my needs. Of course, the caveat is that you would have to decipher all of the Japanese to get what you want, but that is exactly the point.

### YouTube

I recommend watching videos with hard-coded subs; of which there is no shortage of :

</figure>

I primarily watch VTubers, アニメコント, and ボイス漫画. The list is quite long so I have decided to include them in a [separate note](japaneseyoutubers.md).

### Anime & Manga

I will not bother explicitly stating how this can be sourced (since it would change every so often anyways due to copyright), but you can refer to [wotaku.wiki](https://wotaku.wiki/) or any of the other sites listed [here](resourcesforotakus.md) for some ideas, both legal and illegal. Once you have obtained your anime / manga, we will need some tools to load this content into the browser so that we can make use of yomitan. For anime, I get JP subs from [jimaku.cc](https://jimaku.cc) and use [asbplayer](https://github.com/killergerbah/asbplayer), and for manga I use an OCR tool called [mokuro](https://github.com/kha-white/mokuro).

!!! tip

    Official websites like [cmoa.jp](https://www.cmoa.jp/), [booklive](https://booklive.jp/), etc.. frequently provide volumes that are free to read, albeit for a limited time. However, you can bypass this limit by using [scripts](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/445038-cmoa-jp-downloader) to download the content and have it stored locally.

### Music

If you enjoy singing like I do, then singing along to Japanese music is a very fun way to learn. Try glancing through the JP lyrics as you are singing along and before long you will learn to associate the kanji with its sound. You can then take it a step further by trying to translate the lyrics, and then actively recalling the translation whenever you are singing so that you can associate a particular vocabulary/grammar to its meaning and usage as well.

### Others

There are of course other sources of Japanese content like visual novels, light novels, video games, blogs, social media, etc.. I have no experience using them, but you are free to explore those possibilites.

## What's Next?

Now that you have your content, you will be encountering all sorts of unfamiliar vocabulary and grammar. The next step is to turn the *unfamiliar* into the *familiar*, and this is where we enter the "research" phase of the learning process, and is what we will be dealing with in the next part.
