title: "Japanese YouTubers I Watch"
date: 2025-12-28

Despite only understanding like half of what's going on, one of the reasons I continue to watch Japanese YouTube is to improve my Japanese. For that reason, I tend to watch channels that provide JP subtitles to help with the learning process. Hopefully the day will come where I can finally enjoy a video without having to open a dictionary every minute, but for now I have to keep practising. Below are some of the channels I particularly enjoy watching :

## VTubers

I usually watch VTubers from [nijisanji](https://www.nijisanji.jp/en). In particular, stuff from their [main channel](https://www.youtube.com/@nijisanji), [ChroNoiR](https://www.youtube.com/@ChroNoiR), [ROF-MAO](https://www.youtube.com/@ROFMAO), and [seitokai](https://www.youtube.com/@seitokai_07).

Besides nijisanji, I also watch :

- [mafumafu](https://www.youtube.com/@uni_mafumafu) (his [立ち絵動画](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsOuQEiLvG8&list=PLLkGVD9RIO_Cou1S-cNdwBhMfS6nf8QPp) and [変な動画](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CifglC9FtA&list=PLLkGVD9RIO_AVZgiJ5Yjr5qLLA574Inf7) playlists in particular)
- [soraru](https://www.youtube.com/@SorarunoKakurega)
- [amatsuki](https://www.youtube.com/@amatsuki_YHch)
- [ado](https://www.youtube.com/@ado-sense)
- [sutopuri](https://www.youtube.com/@StrawberryPrince)
- [atatakakunaru](https://www.youtube.com/@atatakakunaru) ([takao shinji](https://www.youtube.com/@takaosub) in particular)
- [kokubibi](https://www.youtube.com/@kkvv.)

I also watch clips from these VTubers. They are much shorter compared to videos/streams, and are edited to include subs. Sometimes the clips include animations and drawings which make them more fun to watch. Below are some clip channels I often frequent :

- [朝と海](https://www.youtube.com/@asaandumi)
- [kage](https://www.youtube.com/@kage0123)
- [くじくじ](https://www.youtube.com/@%E3%81%8F%E3%81%98%E3%81%8F%E3%81%98)
- [そらまふ大好きチャネル](https://www.youtube.com/@soramafu-BIGSUKI)
- [yeejya](https://www.youtube.com/@yeejyaaaa)
- [ねむねむにゃんこ | nemu-nemu-nyanko](https://www.youtube.com/@sleepysleepynya)

!!! tip

    You can find more clips of VTubers (or anyone else really) by using `「VTuber」+ 切り抜き / 文字起こし / 手書き` as a search term on YouTube.  

## アニメコント

The コント in アニメコント comes from the french word *conte* which translates to "tale" (as in story, fable, etc..) in English. アニメコント is therefore "animated tales", and it is a popular genre of video in Japan. The western equivalent to アニメコント would probably be something like "animated skits" (think videos/shorts by [Plan3](https://www.youtube.com/@Plan3), etc..) which is also very popular. 

Here are some of the ones I regularly watch :

- [私立パラの丸高校](https://www.youtube.com/@parako)
- [マリマリマリー](https://www.youtube.com/@marymarymary80s)
- [くつずれデイズ](https://www.youtube.com/@Kutsuzure_Days)
- [たすくこま](https://www.youtube.com/@komatasuku)
- [オムオムアニメ【コント】](https://www.youtube.com/@omuomu_anime)
- [ピュティフィ](https://www.youtube.com/@pyutifi)
- [いくとん](https://www.youtube.com/@ikuton_1111)
- [ふじこふじこ](https://www.youtube.com/@fuziko-fuziko)

These ones are more long-form and story (as opposed to gag) oriented, but also very good :

- [テイコウペンギン](https://www.youtube.com/@teipen.official)
- [混血のカレコレ](https://www.youtube.com/@karekoreya)
- [ハンドレッドノート / HUNDRED NOTE【公式】](https://www.youtube.com/@HundredNote-Official)
- [【アニメ】あたしンち公式チャンネル](https://www.youtube.com/@Atashinchi)

## ボイス漫画

As the name suggests, ボイス漫画 (also known as ボイスコミック) are just manga dubs. Often, they are made available by the publishers themselves for promotional purposes. For example, [JUMP!](https://www.youtube.com/@jumpchannel) and [Kadokawa](https://www.youtube.com/@KadokawaOfficial) will sometimes post ボイス漫画 on their channels. Here are some publishers I have found and their respective channels, but there's bound to be loads more :

- [ジャンプチャンネル](https://www.youtube.com/@jumpchannel)
- [KADOKAWAオフィシャルチャンネル](https://www.youtube.com/@KadokawaOfficial)
- [キトラ【KADOKAWAキトラ公式ボイストゥーン】](https://www.youtube.com/@kadokawa6694)
- [コミックエッセイ劇場【公式】](https://www.youtube.com/@KADOKAWAcomicessay)
- [双葉社公式コミックチャンネル](https://www.youtube.com/@futabashacomic)
- [エースこみっくチャンネル](https://www.youtube.com/@AceC_youtube)
- [コミックブリーゼチャンネル【公式】](https://www.youtube.com/@comic_brise)
- [BKレーベル公式【ラノベボイスコミックチャンネル】](https://www.youtube.com/@BKcomics_channel)
- [【公式】PASH!  コミックス・ブックス・文庫](https://www.youtube.com/@pashup8195)
- [ゼロサムYouTubeチャンネル](https://www.youtube.com/@asaandumi)
- [コミックジーンチャンネル](https://www.youtube.com/@comicgene_ch)

ボイス漫画 doesn't necessarily have to be based on an actual published title. If someone wants to make content or tell a story with that style then they are free to do so, and this is exactly what [FermiLab](https://www.youtube.com/@ferumi) (also check out [here](https://www.youtube.com/@rin_lab) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/@fermi_lab)) did to create educational videos. 

## BL

Yes, I watch BL. If it has not been clear, I am a 腐男子 (fudanshi). For some reason (not that I am complaining) there are loads of BL content on YouTube, and I feel that it is best if I just shove all of it into a [separate note](BLLLL.md).

## Misc

This is just a place for YouTube content I watch that don't really fit into the previous categories :

- Table top role playing games (TRPGs), in particular [Call of Cthulu](https://www.chaosium.com/call-of-cthulhu-rpg/), is popular in Japan and is a source of a lot of fun content (check out [あそびいと](https://www.youtube.com/@asobeat_TRPG) and [まにむ](https://www.youtube.com/@manimu_)).
