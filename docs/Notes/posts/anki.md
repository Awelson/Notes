For those who don't know, [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) is a flashcard program which uses [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) to help you learn and memorize stuff. It is especially popular with the Japanese language learning community for memorizing vocabulary and grammar. I have been wanting to study Japanese more seriously so I had to do some digging to figure out which of the many decks (set of flashcards) I should use, and I wanted to share some of what I found in this note.

## Vocabulary

For vocabulary, there seems to be 2 main decks that people use : the JLPT Tango decks, and the Japanese Core decks.

### JLPT Tango

also known as the *Ankidrone Essentials*. This consists of 5 subdecks based on JLPT level (N5, N4, N3, N2, N1) with sentence examples extracted from the [JLPT Tango books](https://ask-books.com/books-ja/) (paste `はじめての日本語能力試験` into the search bar). You can download / find more info about this deck by [clicking here](https://tatsumoto.neocities.org/blog/ankidrone-essentials).

### Japanese Core

This deck is based on the 6,000 most common Japanese words as per [iknow.jp](https://iknow.jp/content/japanese). The [Core 2k](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2141233552) deck contains just the first 2,000 words while the [Core 2k/6k](https://ankiweb.net/shared/by-author/1880390099) deck contains all 6,000. There is also a [Core 10k](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/120401384) deck which contains an extra 4,000 words (I am not sure where from). You can browse the contents of these decks online at [https://core6000.neocities.org](https://core6000.neocities.org). 

!!! warning 

    As of right now (December 2025), the core6000 website is unreachable, but you can still access a historic copy of it through the [internet archive](https://archive.org/). 

### Other Decks

You can find other decks [here](https://djtguide.github.io/library/benkyou.html). Some notable alternatives include the [Core 2.3k](https://anacreondjt.gitlab.io/docs/coredeck/) and [Kaishi 1.5k](https://github.com/donkuri/kaishi) which are (successfull) attempts at refining the original Tango and Core decks.

## Grammar

The [Dictionary of Japanese Grammar (DoJG)](https://www.tofugu.com/reviews/dictionary-of-basic-japanese-grammar/) is basically regarded as **THE** bible for Japanese grammar. You can find an online version of it [here](https://gohoneko.neocities.org/grammar/dojg/dojgall) as well as the associated Anki deck [here](https://gohoneko.neocities.org/grammar/dojg/dojgdeck).

## Making Your Own Deck

After learning some few thousand words, a lot of people suggest moving on to building your own Anki decks. The idea is : whenever you encounter a word you don't know and would like to learn (say while watching an anime), you can extract that word and the surrounding context and turn it into a flashcard; this is known as [*sentence mining*](https://tatsumoto-ren.github.io/blog/sentence-mining.html) which falls under the more general hood of *immersion-based learning*. 

There are **VERY** detailed setups / guides on how to do this, some of them also include software and workflows to help automate flashcard creation. Personally, I can't be bothered, but it is fascinating to see some of the effort and research people put into this stuff. I'd like to showcase some of these guides below :

- [animecards](https://animecards.site/ankisetup/)
- [donkuri](https://donkuri.github.io/learn-japanese/guide/)
- [lazyguide](https://lazyguidejp.github.io/jp-lazy-guide/)
- [jp-mining-note](https://arbyste.github.io/jp-mining-note/)
- [itazuraneko](https://djtguide.github.io/learn/anki.html)
- [tatsumoto-ren](https://tatsumoto-ren.github.io/blog/setting-up-anki.html)
