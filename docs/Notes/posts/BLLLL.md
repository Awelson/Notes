It is not an exaggeration to say that I live and breathe off of watching and reading BL. If you are anything like me, then you will find some of the resources I have gathered below to be helpful. If you are not, then I would **strongly** suggest that you give it a shot. For some good starting points, you can try to check out some of my favorite BLs :

## My Favorite BLs

For anime, I really enjoyed [Sasaki and Miyano](https://myanimelist.net/anime/44055), [Given](https://myanimelist.net/anime/39533), and [Stranger by the Shore](https://myanimelist.net/anime/40615) (also check out their respective source manga!). For manga/manhwa, there is [One-Room TA](https://myanimelist.net/manga/172823), [Scene of my Rumspringa](https://myanimelist.net/manga/121082) (and the spin-off, [Dear Gene](https://myanimelist.net/manga/127572)), and [Merry Marbling](https://myanimelist.net/manga/159718).

        *Uyun from One-Room TA* (which I especially like).

## BL YouTube

For some reason (not that I am complaining) there are loads of BL content available on YouTube. They are mostly in the form of short animations (アニメコント) or BL manga dubs (ボイス漫画). Here are some channels I really like :

- [BLサンドいかがですか?](https://www.youtube.com/@BLsandwich)
- [GUSH_&.Emo公式【BLボイスコミックチャンネル】](https://www.youtube.com/@GUSH_and.Emo_BLch)
- [アンジェンテ【BLボイスコミックチャンネル】](https://www.youtube.com/@BL_andGENTE)
- [CIELフルールチャンネル【全話無料BLボイスコミック更新中】](https://www.youtube.com/@blchannel_cf)
- [BLスキップ! オリジナル漫画とアニメ](https://www.youtube.com/@blskip)

There are soooo many more, and you can find some of them [here](https://gist.github.com/Awelson/09b510ecb4ea4b59f3e380faff2625cf).
