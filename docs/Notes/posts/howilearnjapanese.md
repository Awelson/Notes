title: "How I Learn Japanese (Part 1) : Intro"
date: 2025-12-23
---

In this multi-part note, I will outline how I learn Japanese and which resources I typically use. To put it shortly, what I do on a pretty much daily basis is watch or read Japanese content, say from anime, YouTube, manga, news, etc.. I am not sure what the effective amount is, but personally, about half of what I consume is Japanese (because I am just that much of a weeb). If I encounter a word or grammar that I am not familiar with, I will try to do some research. Afterwards, I will go back to the sentence (where the word/grammar originated) and check to see if what I have learned makes sense in the original context. Rinse and repeat and that is basically all I have been doing up till this point. 

Obivously, what I am describing is not new; it falls under what is known as [active immersion](https://tatsumoto-ren.github.io/blog/active-immersion.html). The effectiveness of immersion in comparison to more traditional methods (textbooks, etc..) is a popular (and sometimes toxic) [topic of debate](https://community.wanikani.com/t/can-you-learn-purely-through-immersion/66988) in the Japanese language learning community. I do not claim that whatever I am doing will work for you, but at the very least there may be some ideas you can use.

## Background

I will point out that I did not initially plan to study Japanese, but I enjoyed Japanese YouTubers (I was first introduced through translated clips), and there was eventually a need (which translated clips alone could not satisfy) to watch their content and keep up with the latest info. With the limited amount of Japanese I knew at the time and through sheer stubbornness towards wanting to be part of the fandom, I would painstakingly try to translate and understand videos, tweets, comments, etc.. myself. Without realizing, it became a routine which I'd spend hours each day doing and my Japanese got better just as a byproduct; after all, the main goal was just trying to be part of the fandom.

> I guess what I am trying to say is that motivation is super important for learning new languages, so it might be helpful to think about *why* you want to be able to understand Japanese in the first place and focus on that as a goal instead, i.e. we want to make it so that learning Japanese becomes a means to an end. It is important that whatever goal you choose should **absolutely** require knowing Japanese to be achieved; something like "I want to be able to enjoy anime" is not ideal since you could always default to using translations to achieve that goal.

Obviously, this "workflow" will require you to know a bit of Japanese beforehand. At a minimum, you should aim towards already knowing about 30-40% of the vocabulary / grammar you will encounter for this to work without friction; in terms of JLPT levels, this probably amounts to somewhere between N4 and N3. The idea is : you want to be able to get to a point where you can, on your own, be able to at least understand the main plot of whatever it is you are watching or reading so that there is some form of enjoyment to be gained from the process; I just arbitrarily decided that knowing about 30-40% of the content should be enough for this task. You can refer to some of the excellent guides I showcased in [an earlier note](japaneseguide.md) to help you get started to reaching this point. 

## What's Next? 

In the next part, I will be talking about how I source Japanese content to watch / read, as well as some of the tools I use to help streamline this process.

<!--

## What do I watch/read?

### YouTube

I recommend watching videos with hard-coded subs; of which there is no shortage of

<figure markdown="span">

</figure>

I primarily watch VTubers, アニメコント, and ボイス漫画. These types of content will most probably come with hard-coded subs.

#### VTubers

I usually watch VTubers from [nijisanji](https://www.nijisanji.jp/en). In particular, stuff from their [main channel](https://www.youtube.com/@nijisanji), [ChroNoiR](https://www.youtube.com/@ChroNoiR), [ROF-MAO](https://www.youtube.com/@ROFMAO), and [seitokai](https://www.youtube.com/@seitokai_07), which primarily hosts game-show type content with the VTubers using their 3D models. Having the content be structured also makes it easier to follow along.

Besides nijisanji, I also watch :

- [mafumafu](https://www.youtube.com/@uni_mafumafu) (his [立ち絵動画](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsOuQEiLvG8&list=PLLkGVD9RIO_Cou1S-cNdwBhMfS6nf8QPp) and [変な動画](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CifglC9FtA&list=PLLkGVD9RIO_AVZgiJ5Yjr5qLLA574Inf7) playlists in particular)
- [soraru](https://www.youtube.com/@SorarunoKakurega)
- [amatsuki](https://www.youtube.com/@amatsuki_YHch)
- [ado](https://www.youtube.com/@ado-sense)
- [sutopuri](https://www.youtube.com/@StrawberryPrince)
- [atatakakunaru](https://www.youtube.com/@atatakakunaru) ([takao shinji](https://www.youtube.com/@takaosub) in particular)
- [kokubibi](https://www.youtube.com/@kkvv.)

I also watch clips from these VTubers. They are much shorter compared to videos/streams, and are edited to include subs. Sometimes the clips include animations and drawings which make them fun to watch. Below are some clip channels I often frequent :

- [朝と海](https://www.youtube.com/@asaandumi)
- [kage](https://www.youtube.com/@kage0123)
- [くじくじ](https://www.youtube.com/@%E3%81%8F%E3%81%98%E3%81%8F%E3%81%98)
- [そらまふ大好きチャネル](https://www.youtube.com/@soramafu-BIGSUKI)
- [yeejya](https://www.youtube.com/@yeejyaaaa)
- [ねむねむにゃんこ | nemu-nemu-nyanko](https://www.youtube.com/@sleepysleepynya)

!!! note

    You can find more clips of VTubers (or anyone else really) by using `「VTuber」+ 切り抜き / 文字起こし / 手書き` as a search term on YouTube.  

#### アニメコント

The コント in アニメコント comes from the french word *conte* which translates to "tale" (as in story, fable, etc..) in English. アニメコント is therefore "animated tales", and it is a popular video genre in Japan. The western equivalent to アニメコント would probably be something like "animated skits" (think videos/shorts by [Plan3](https://www.youtube.com/@Plan3), etc..) which is also very popular. Anyways, these videos are not only good because of their short length and inclusion of subtitles, but also because they are genuinely funny. Here are some of the ones I regularly watch :

- [私立パラの丸高校](https://www.youtube.com/@parako)
- [マリマリマリー](https://www.youtube.com/@marymarymary80s)
- [くつずれデイズ](https://www.youtube.com/@Kutsuzure_Days)
- [たすくこま](https://www.youtube.com/@komatasuku)
- [オムオムアニメ【コント】](https://www.youtube.com/@omuomu_anime)
- [ピュティフィ](https://www.youtube.com/@pyutifi)
- [いくとん](https://www.youtube.com/@ikuton_1111)

These ones are more long-form and story (as opposed to gag) oriented, but also very good :

- [テイコウペンギン](https://www.youtube.com/@teipen.official)
- [混血のカレコレ](https://www.youtube.com/@karekoreya)
- [ハンドレッドノート / HUNDRED NOTE【公式】](https://www.youtube.com/@HundredNote-Official)
- [【アニメ】あたしンち公式チャンネル](https://www.youtube.com/@Atashinchi)

#### ボイス漫画

As the name suggests, ボイス漫画 are just dubs of mangas. While some are fan-made, most are made by the publishers themselves and are free to access on their YouTube channels. For example, JUMP! and Kadokawa will sometimes post ボイス漫画 on their channels. Here are some good sources :

- [ジャンプチャンネル](https://www.youtube.com/@jumpchannel)
- [キトラ【KADOKAWAキトラ公式ボイストゥーン】](https://www.youtube.com/@kadokawa6694)
- [KADOKAWAanime](https://www.youtube.com/@KADOKAWAanime)
- [コミックエッセイ劇場【公式】](https://www.youtube.com/@KADOKAWAcomicessay)
- [双葉社公式コミックチャンネル](https://www.youtube.com/@futabashacomic)
- [エースこみっくチャンネル](https://www.youtube.com/@AceC_youtube)
- [コミックブリーゼチャンネル【公式】](https://www.youtube.com/@comic_brise)
- [BKレーベル公式【ラノベボイスコミックチャンネル】](https://www.youtube.com/@BKcomics_channel)
- [【公式】PASH!  コミックス・ブックス・文庫](https://www.youtube.com/@pashup8195)
- [ゼロサムYouTubeチャンネル](https://www.youtube.com/@asaandumi)

ボイス漫画 doesn't necessarily have to be based on an actual published manga, if someone wants to make content or tell a story with that style then they are free to do so, and this is exactly what [FermiLab](https://www.youtube.com/@ferumi) (also check out [here](https://www.youtube.com/@rin_lab) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/@fermi_lab)) did to create educational videos. 

#### Misc

This is just a place for YouTube content that doesn't really fit into the previous three categories :

- Table top role playing games (TRPGs). In particular, [Call of Cthulu](https://www.chaosium.com/call-of-cthulhu-rpg/) is popular in Japan and is a source of a lot of fun content (check out [あそびいと](https://www.youtube.com/@asobeat_TRPG) and [まにむ](https://www.youtube.com/@manimu_)).

!!! note

    I have been intentionally excluding BL content thus far (If it has not been clear, I am a fudanshi). This is because I kind of want all the BL content to be in a separate note, and its probably better that way since for some reason there is SOOO much BL content available so it would have just taken up a lot of space if I were to list them here. Whenever I am finished writing the BL note, I will include a link here so you can check it out if so inclined.

### Anime

I will not bother stating which website/method I use to watch anime (it would change every few months anyway due to copyright), but you can refer to [wotaku.wiki](https://wotaku.wiki/) or any of the other sites listed [here](resourcesforotakus.md) for some ideas (both legal and illegal). I get JP subs from [jimaku.cc](https://jimaku.cc) and use [asbplayer](https://github.com/killergerbah/asbplayer) as a video player. It runs directly on the browser and makes subtitle text selectable, which is useful because you can pair it with a pop-up dictionary like [yomitan](https://yomitan.wiki/) to look up quickly look up definitions. 

### Manga

As with anime, I will not explicitly state how this can be sourced, but you can refer to the resources I have linked above. Once you have obtained your manga, you can use OCR tools like [mokuro](https://github.com/kha-white/mokuro) which allows you to read manga with selectable text inside a browser. Again, this is useful because you can pair it with [yomitan](https://yomitan.wiki/) to look up definitions easily.

I will further add that official websites like [cmoa.jp](https://www.cmoa.jp/) and [booklive](https://booklive.jp/) will sometimes provide free to read volumes (albeit for a limited time). You can then use [scripts](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/445038-cmoa-jp-downloader) to download the content so as to not worry about the time limit. 

## How do I "research" vocabulary/grammar?

Before getting started, I would highly recommended that you get [yomitan](https://yomitan.wiki/) and a [Japanese keyboard](https://www.google.co.jp/ime/) set up. It will take some time to get used to typing in Japanese, but [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRtkiRchnF8) is a good video to get you started.

### Vocabulary

If you encounter a word you are not familiar with, the first step is to of course look up its definition. For most cases, yomitan will suffice. However, sometimes more work needs to be done. The two main problems that you will run into are :

- The word shows up in yomitan, but none of the listed definitions make sense given the context.
- The word does not show up in yomitan.

!!! note "Problem 1"

    It is possible that the word in question can be viewed as slang. For example, “toxic” traditionally means “poisonous”, but as a slang, it is used to describe an unhealthy or harmful personality, relationship, or environment. In Japanese, the word マグロ traditionally means "tuna", but it also has a more [adult meaning](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%9E%E3%82%B0%E3%83%AD_(%E3%82%A2%E3%83%80%E3%83%AB%E3%83%88)): a person who is inactive during sexual intercourse. 
    
    While yomitan (or more specifically [jitendex](https://jitendex.org/)) is not blind to マグロ's alternative meaning, this behavior is not always guaranteed. In case yomitan fails, you can use [zokugo](http://search.zokugo-dict.com/) (basically [urban dictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com/) but for Japanese). Alternatively, you can try adding 「スラング・俗語・通言・隠語」 to the end of your word before searching it up online.

!!! note "Problem 2"

    The two possibilites are: either the word in question is too obscure, or it is derived from pop culture, memes, etc... In either case, searching the word up online usually helps. For example, the word フェイファ gets brought up a lot in [The Apothecary Diaries](https://myanimelist.net/anime/54492/Kusuriya_no_Hitorigoto). The word didn't show up in any dictionaries, but an online search led to [this page](https://dic.pixiv.net/a/%E9%A3%9B%E7%99%BA) on the [pixiv encyclopedia](https://dic.pixiv.net/) which suggested that it was a made up word specific to the anime. 

    In general, the [pixiv encyclopedia](https://dic.pixiv.net/) is very useful for these more modern, pop culture type words. The YouTube channel [Scripting Japan](https://www.youtube.com/@scriptingjapan) is also a good resource to keep up with Japanese slang and pop culture, and there have been many instances where I was able to understand a joke in a video or a comment because I had watched a Scripting Japan video before hand. Alternatively, monolingual dictionaries (I use [weblio](https://www.weblio.jp/)) are generally more comprehensive compared to their bilingual counterparts and they may help with the more obscure words.

!!! tip

    How relevant is a word?

!!! tip

    If your word is fully in kanji, your search results will most likely be in Chinese. To mitigate this, you can attach 「とは」 at the end of your word before searching it up.

!!! tip

    It is a good idea to also look up related words (synonyms, antonyms, words that use the same kanji, etc..). For example, noticing the connection between 折る (to fold) and 折り紙 (origami) makes it almost impossible to forget the meaning of 折る. You can use [thesaurus.weblio.jp](https://thesaurus.weblio.jp/) for synonyms and antonyms,  

!!! tip

    When studying vocabulary, some people like to ignore English loan words. While this is fair to do for some words like アイスクリム (ice cream), there are loan words which, whilst retaining the original English meaning, have adopted a completely distinct pattern of usage. For example, the word アピール (appeal) is quite commonly used
