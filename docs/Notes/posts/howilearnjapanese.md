In this note, I will outline how I learn Japanese and which resources I typically use. To put it shortly, what I do on a pretty much daily basis is watch or read Japanese content, say from anime, YouTube, manga, news, etc.. I am not sure what the effective amount is, but personally, about half of what I consume is Japanese (because I am just that much of a weeb). If I encounter a word or grammar that I am not familiar with, I will try to do some research. Afterwards, I will go back to the sentence (where the word/grammar originated) and check to see if what I have learned makes sense. Rinse and repeat and that is basically all I have been doing up till this point. 

Obivously, what I am describing is not new; it falls under what is known as [active immersion](https://tatsumoto-ren.github.io/blog/active-immersion.html). The effectiveness of immersion in comparison to more traditional methods (textbooks, etc..) is a popular (and sometimes toxic) [topic of debate](https://community.wanikani.com/t/can-you-learn-purely-through-immersion/66988) in the Japanese language learning community. I do not claim that whatever I am doing will work for you, but at the very least there may be some ideas you can use.

## Background

I will point out that I did not initially plan to study Japanese, but I enjoyed Japanese YouTubers (I was first introduced through translated clips), and there was eventually a need (which translated clips alone could not satisfy) to watch their content and keep up with the latest info. With the limited amount of Japanese I knew at the time and through sheer stubbornness towards wanting to be part of the fandom, I would painstakingly try to translate and understand videos, tweets, comments, etc.. myself. Without realizing, it became a routine which I'd spend hours each day doing and my Japanese got better just as a byproduct; after all, the main goal was just trying to be part of the fandom.

I guess what I am trying to say is that it might be helpful to think about *why* you want to be able to understand Japanese and focus on that as a goal so that you are only using Japanese as a means to an end. It is important that whatever goal you choose should **absolutely** require knowing Japanese to be achieved; something like "I want to be able to enjoy anime" is not ideal since you could always default to using translations.

Obviously, this "workflow" will require you to know a bit of Japanese beforehand. At a minimum, you should aim towards already knowing about 30-40% of the vocabulary / grammar you will encounter for this to work without friction; in terms of JLPT levels, this probably amounts to somewhere between N4 and N3. The idea is : you want to be able to get to a point where you can, on your own, be able to at least understand the main plot of whatever it is you are watching or reading so that there is some form of enjoyment to be gained from the process; I just arbitrarily decided that knowing about 30-40% of the content should be enough for this task. You can refer to some of the excellent guides I showcased in [an earlier note](japaneseguide.md) to help you get started to reaching this point. 

## What do I watch / read?

### YouTube

I recommend watching videos with hard-coded subs; of which there is no shortage of

I primarily watch VTubers, アニメコント, and ボイス漫画. These types of content will most probably come with hard-coded subs.

#### VTubers

I usually watch VTubers from [nijisanji](https://www.nijisanji.jp/en) in particular, stuff from their [main channel](https://www.youtube.com/@nijisanji), [ChroNoiR](https://www.youtube.com/@ChroNoiR), [ROF-MAO](https://www.youtube.com/@ROFMAO), and [seitokai](https://www.youtube.com/@seitokai_07), which primarily hosts game-show type content with the VTubers using their 3D models. Having the content be structured also makes it easier to follow along.

Besides nijisanji, I also watch :

- [mafumafu](https://www.youtube.com/@uni_mafumafu) (his [立ち絵動画](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsOuQEiLvG8&list=PLLkGVD9RIO_Cou1S-cNdwBhMfS6nf8QPp) and [変な動画](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CifglC9FtA&list=PLLkGVD9RIO_AVZgiJ5Yjr5qLLA574Inf7) playlists in particular)
- [soraru](https://www.youtube.com/@SorarunoKakurega)
- [amatsuki](https://www.youtube.com/@amatsuki_YHch)
- [ado](https://www.youtube.com/@ado-sense)
- [sutopuri](https://www.youtube.com/@StrawberryPrince)
- [atatakakunaru](https://www.youtube.com/@atatakakunaru) ([takao shinji](https://www.youtube.com/@takaosub) in particular)
- [kokubibi](https://www.youtube.com/@kkvv.)

I also watch clips from these VTubers. They are much shorter compared to videos / streams, and are edited to include subs. Sometimes the clips include animations and drawings which make them fun to watch. Below are some clip channels I often frequent :

- [朝と海](https://www.youtube.com/@asaandumi)
- [kage](https://www.youtube.com/@kage0123)
- [くじくじ](https://www.youtube.com/@%E3%81%8F%E3%81%98%E3%81%8F%E3%81%98)
- [そらまふ大好きチャネル](https://www.youtube.com/@soramafu-BIGSUKI)
- [yeejya](https://www.youtube.com/@yeejyaaaa)
- [ねむねむにゃんこ | nemu-nemu-nyanko](https://www.youtube.com/@sleepysleepynya)

!!! note

    You can find more VTuber (or anyone else really) clips by using `「VTuber」+ 切り抜き / 文字起こし / 手書き` as a search term on YouTube.
